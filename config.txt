Description:
The Homeworld Remastered 2.3 Players Patch resolves many bugs, exploits, and balance issues from the 2.1 Patch. It includes the changes from Gearboxâ€™s unfinished 2.205 Patch Preview, plus many additional improvements. It enhances singleplayer and multiplayer while respecting the look, sound, and feel of Relic's classics. Notably it fixes the 666 Formation Bug, the Cross Race Docking Bug, and is authored by the players who helped Gearbox balance Homeworld Remastered. It also features additional gameplay options including a campaign difficulty adjuster, UI/camera adjusters, dual command mode, observer mode, vast unit caps, and much more.
